    "## Step 1: Create the Conda Environment\n",
    "Open your terminal (on macOS/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (on Windows) and run the following command to create a new Conda environment named image_scraper with Python 3.11:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda create --name image_scraper python=3.11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Activate the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the newly created environment using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda activate image_scraper\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Install Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the necessary libraries for web scraping (Selenium and Requests), WebDriver Manager for Selenium driver management, and Jupyter to run and manage your notebooks. Here's the command sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda install selenium requests jupyter -c conda-forge\n",
    "pip install webdriver-manager\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using -c conda-forge specifies that Conda should install these packages from the Conda-Forge repository, which often has more up-to-date packages than the default channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Install Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "To make your image_scraper environment available as a kernel in Jupyter Notebooks, install ipykernel and add it as a kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda install ipykernel -c conda-forge\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=image_scraper --display-name=\"Python 3.11 (image_scraper)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command adds the image_scraper environment as a kernel option in Jupyter, allowing you to select it when working on notebooks related to your image scraping project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Run Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "See code below for the image scraper:\n"
